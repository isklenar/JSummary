SAN FRANCISCO – Science provides an invaluable source of guidance to individuals and governments.
This is true, in part, because scientists can often predict the future consequences of current actions.
For example, the United States government is well-served by an organization called the National Academies, based on three honorary organizations composed of the nation’s most distinguished scientists, engineers, and health professionals (the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, respectively).
However, there are other important science-based issues that require study by internationally-based organizations in order to be widely accepted.
To meet this need, the InterAcademy Council (IAC) in Amsterdam was founded in 2000 by a worldwide organization of science academies called the InterAcademy Panel (IAP).
The IAC is governed by a Board that includes a rotating group of 15 Academy presidents from around the world, representing nations at a range of economic development levels, and its reports present a truly international perspective backed by the world’s best scientists and engineers.
The IAC provides advice on subjects requested by the United Nations and other international organizations, all of which is freely available at www.interacademycouncil.net.
The combination of the IAP and the IAC is an important new experiment for providing international scientific advice – an experiment that has only just begun to demonstrate its potential effectiveness for spreading the benefits of science and technology to all humanity.
