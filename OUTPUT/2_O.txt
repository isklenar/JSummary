BAMAKO, MALI – Media organizations in wealthy countries regularly send forth reporters to find “victims of global warming.” In dispatches from the Pacific Islands, Bangladesh, or Ethiopia, journalists warn of impending calamity.
Global warming is the most horrific challenge facing these regions, we are told.
Its resolution is vital.
But seldom do we hear from the local people who are said to be in danger.
These people are not voiceless; we just pay no attention to what they say.
The Copenhagen Consensus Center set out to ask people in global-warming hot spots about their fears and hopes.
In Mojo, central Ethiopia, our researchers met Tadese Denkue, a 68-year-old former soldier with no regular income.
“I never know when I will be able to buy myself some food,” he said.
“I only know that I suffer a lot.
This is not a decent life.”
Tadese has never heard of global warming.
When it is explained to him, he is dismissive.
He has more immediate concerns: “The first thing I need is food, and then a job.”
Tadese is suffering from his second bout of malaria this year.
He has lost count of how many times he has contracted the disease.
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic.
The electricity is not working.
A doctor admits that most patients are sent home without testing or treatment: the clinic has run out of medicine.
The threat of more malaria has been used to argue for drastic carbon cuts.
