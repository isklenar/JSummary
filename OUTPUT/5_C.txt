BERLIN – Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has fought seven wars against its neighbors, including the recent war in Gaza.
Indeed, the core conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has remained almost unchanged throughout the past 60 years.
The United Nations’ Partition Plan of 1947, which split the former British Mandate of Palestine between both peoples, was not and still is not accepted until this day.
Without a territorial compromise between Israel and the Palestinians, the conflict will go on endlessly, for it is viewed as existential by both sides.
But, while it is abundantly clear that Israel will not vanish, and that the Palestinians will not wave the white flag, the conditions for a two-state solution are deteriorating.
Hamas rejects any peace with Israel, and is at best prepared to agree to a temporary truce.
Given the facts on the ground created by Israel, there are justified doubts about whether a two-state solution is feasible at all.
Whatever becomes of Hamas in military terms following the recent fighting in Gaza, politically it has finally taken over the PLO’s role as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
Both Israel and the West will no longer be able to postpone the question of how to deal with Hamas, because Abbas and Fatah are now too weak and discredited to negotiate a peace settlement.
The alternative to a two-state solution is continuation of the conflict and the de facto reality of a one-state solution in which Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will, sooner rather than later, constitute a majority.
Trying to extricate both parties from the strategic dead-end into which they have maneuvered themselves will be possible only from outside.
If an imposed solution fails, the entire region will begin to slip into a dangerous confrontation during the first years of Barack Obama’s presidency.
