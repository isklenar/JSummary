If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes.
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets, which are treated with insecticide.
These nets cover people while they sleep, and repel or kill the mosquitoes, which tend to bite during the night.
First, Africa’s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines.
Second, African villagers lack access to cars or trucks, so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic.
Rich countries would buy bed nets from companies that produce them and work with African governments to distribute them free of charge to every African household.
Rather than giving away bed nets, rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor, albeit at heavily discounted prices.
Rather than shipping medicines to each country on the basis of estimated needs, donor agencies have set up a complicated purchasing system that has led to years of delay in getting medicines to the villages.
Malaria is spreading, and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria.
The world’s safety, including the safety of people living in rich countries, depends on the global community’s ability to prove that it will come to the aid of all who are in desperate need.
