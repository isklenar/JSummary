CHICAGO – Throughout the West, declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity.
But the West now faces serious competition from the rising nations of Asia, where education in math and science is flourishing.
Yet today, the vast majority of high schools start the study of science with biology.
In America, the requirement is usually for three years of science study, and, today, most U.S. students take science in this order: biology, chemistry, physics.
I believe that it is obsolete, pedagogically disastrous, and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century.
Studying science should begin with physics, not biology.
Ninth-grade physics, unlike ninth-grade biology, illustrates the grand sweep of the laws of nature, and the power of an equation to describe a vast number of different phenomena can be taught at this level.
Tenth-grade chemistry makes use of ninth-grade physics, deepening and enriching the student’s grasp, but no basic chemical or biological principles are required for ninth-grade physics.
Teachers (including those in mathematics) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses, their essential coherence, and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works.
But to restore the vitality of science, we need to look at the entire educational system: teachers from pre-school through high school, state and national standards, productive and educationally reinforcing assessments, teaching materials and educational technology, and progress in the neurosciences, cognitive psychology, developmental biology, and nutrition.
