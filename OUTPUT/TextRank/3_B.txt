For some time, scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9% genetically identical.
The 0.1% of the genome that was different (approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA) was comprised of “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA) scattered throughout the genome.
In the summer of 2004, two groups of scientists working independently (one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) called this scientific dogma into question.
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies.
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared.
These became known as copy number variants, or CNVs.
Using two complementary genome-wide technologies, with subsequent validation studies, a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified.
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought.
Indeed, as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs, we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations, complex diseases, and human adaptability.
