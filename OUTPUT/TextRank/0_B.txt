MELBOURNE – In April, Germany’s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis.
Some provisions of the German law draw on the widely shared ethical principles of respect for individual autonomy and privacy.
Desirable as these provisions seem, they could impose a heavy cost on German companies.
The German law’s most controversial feature is a prohibition on prenatal genetic testing for diseases that will manifest themselves only in adulthood.
When we have a choice between lives with such different prospects – and can make the choice before the embryo or fetus has any awareness at all – shouldn’t we be able to choose the child with the better prospects?
It is not surprising that questions about genetic tests should receive special attention in Germany, given the national imperative of avoiding any repetition of the crimes of the Nazi era.
But, in their laudable desire to distance themselves as much as possible from those atrocities, Germany’s legislators have enacted a law that makes it a crime to use modern science to avoid undoubted human tragedies.
That is an absurd outcome.
