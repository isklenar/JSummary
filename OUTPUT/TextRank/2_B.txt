Right now, a genome is akin to a novel written in an unknown language.
There is a huge amount of information in there, but we can’t understand it.
And just as it usually takes several individuals to cause an incident, so it often takes several genetic variations, plus ambient factors, to cause a disease.
There are two key challenges in genomics.
One is simply detecting the genes, alone or in combination, that seem to lead to certain diseases.
The second challenge is to understand how the genes interact among themselves or with other factors to produce the condition, which should enable the development of new preventive measures or treatments based on the details of how the condition begins and how it progresses.
While some researchers are looking for statistical correlations, others are studying how the individual genes interact.
For all of them, access to genome sequences is important.
But the genomes mean little without the corresponding medical records, just as the Russian novel – in any language – means little without a corresponding knowledge of Russian history.
The current movement in many developed countries towards electronic medical records will improve health care directly, but it will also lead to much improved information liquidity to help genetic and other medical research.
The challenge five years from now will be to turn all that knowledge into practice through better preventive measures, better drugs, and better care.
