BERLIN – Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has fought seven wars against its neighbors, including the recent war in Gaza.
From a military perspective, Israel eventually won all of these wars – or at least didn’t lose them.
Indeed, the core conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has remained almost unchanged throughout the past 60 years.
The United Nations’ Partition Plan of 1947, which split the former British Mandate of Palestine between both peoples, was not and still is not accepted until this day.
This is why, to this day, people on both sides are dying.
The central question for both sides remains unanswered: where does Israel end and Palestine start?
But, while it is abundantly clear that Israel will not vanish, and that the Palestinians will not wave the white flag, the conditions for a two-state solution are deteriorating.
The alternative to a two-state solution is continuation of the conflict and the de facto reality of a one-state solution in which Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will, sooner rather than later, constitute a majority.
First, the United States must attempt to integrate Syria and Iran into a regional solution that also fundamentally changes conditions for both Israelis and Palestinians.
Second, the US must impose a two-state solution on the parties involved, which will require both determination and maintaining the unity of the main international actors.
