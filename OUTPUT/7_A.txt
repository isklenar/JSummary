Palestinians identify strongly with the civil rights movement in the United States.
Whereas previously the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had campaigned for a single, secular, and democratic state across the entirety of mandatory Palestine, our Declaration of Independence endorsed a two-state solution.
Endorsing a two-state solution meant recognizing Israeli sovereignty over 78% of our homeland and exercising our right to self-determination on only the remaining 22% that Israel has occupied militarily since 1967: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.
As Obama prepares to enter the White House, we are confident that he will consider the constructive role America can play in the search for peace and security.
Second, the US should establish a credible enforcement mechanism to ensure that the parties comply with their respective obligations, particularly an immediate freeze on Israeli settlement activity throughout the occupied Palestinian territory.
Third, the new administration should encourage the re-engagement of its Quartet partners – the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia – in the mediation process.
Fourth, the US should renew its respect for international law by recognizing three principles: that the 1967 pre-occupation boundaries must be respected in any negotiations; that Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem must be safeguarded, with guaranteed access for Muslims, Christians, and Jews to their holy sites; and that the plight of Palestinian refugees, whose 60-year ordeal remains emblematic of the Palestinian predicament, must be acknowledged and fairly addressed.
The 2002 Arab Peace Initiative offers Israel a unique opportunity: full normalization of relations with 57 Arab and Muslim states in return for a comprehensive peace agreement, including an end to Israel’s occupation of Arab lands and a just and agreed upon solution for refugees.
