It is possible for a child born just ten years from now to live in a world where AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are on the wane.
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 peopleâ€”devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty.
A key instrument is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.
Any strategy for raising living standards must include urgent measures that address AIDS, TB and malaria.
Investments in effective prevention, treatment and research in 2005 and 2006 will save millions of lives, lessen the socio-economic impact of the diseases in poorer countries, and remove the need for increased spending on these chronic crises in the future.
The Global Fund plays an important role in this funding environment, providing approximately 66% of all current external funds in the fight against TB, 45% in the fight against malaria, and 20% of all external support to combat HIV/AIDS.
If the Fund is to live up to its potential it will need $2.3 billion to continue its work effectively in 2005.
