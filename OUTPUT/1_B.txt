CHICAGO – Throughout the West, declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity.
One reform that demands priority today concerns high school science.
All other sciences – geology, astronomy, neuroscience, oceanography, and myriad hyphenated subjects – depend upon overlapping combinations of biology, chemistry, and physics.
Yet today, the vast majority of high schools start the study of science with biology.
Studying science should begin with physics, not biology.
At all stages of the science curriculum, basic questions must be asked.
How does something work?
How do we know?
What are the common laws?
Teachers (including those in mathematics) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses, their essential coherence, and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works.
