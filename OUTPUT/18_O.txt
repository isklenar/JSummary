This is both short-sighted and hazardous.
But little of this attention has been aimed at post-secondary science education, the only level for which there is data showing how to make substantial improvements without enormous costs.
The results of this research, and the dramatically improved gains in learning and interest achieved in associated teaching experiments, show that there are tremendous opportunities to improve university science education.
It also requires abandoning the longstanding and widespread assumption that understanding science means simply learning a requisite body of facts and problem-solving recipes, and that mastery of those facts is the sole qualification needed to be a science teacher.
For example, bloodletting had been in use for thousands of years, with detailed theories explaining its effectiveness.
With continued research and effective implementation of new findings about science education, it will be possible to achieve far more meaningful science learning for all university students.
Giving students a deeper understanding of the world around them is inherently enriching.
It will also enable them to make wiser decisions on critically important matters of public policy, and to be far more creative and effective members of the work force.
