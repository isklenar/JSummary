Ugly debates about religion and science usually seem to be confined to the United States.
In recent months, however, such debates have begun to spread – first to Europe and then around the world.
Science, it seems, is drifting into political dangers it has not faced since before the Enlightenment.
The danger is that scientific decisions with a scientific-technical component are no longer subject to study or rational argument, but instead are fought over by various interest groups, with some invariably claiming that their taxes should be used to fund only research that is compatible with their values.
Although the language of religion was not used overtly, the debate in Asia reflected the same fears that science is somehow “out of control” and far too powerful.
Cultural worldviews and religion, of course, will continue to shape the overall cultural and value context within which science and technology interact.
It took centuries for science to carve out its sphere of autonomy, always a relative one, from politics and religion alike.
This autonomy has served science well, and independent and accountable science has served society and the economy well.
If this beneficial relationship is to be maintained, scientific independence – from both religious dogmatism and governmental intervention – must be defended.
