These are but two examples of thousands of instances in which it makes good sense for decision-makers to take into account what science can predict about the future.
However, there are other important science-based issues that require study by internationally-based organizations in order to be widely accepted.
To meet this need, the InterAcademy Council (IAC) in Amsterdam was founded in 2000 by a worldwide organization of science academies called the InterAcademy Panel (IAP).
It argued convincingly for the importance of supporting science and technology institutions in every nation that focus on harnessing the increasing store of international scientific and technical knowledge to meet that nation’s needs.
The combination of the IAP and the IAC is an important new experiment for providing international scientific advice – an experiment that has only just begun to demonstrate its potential effectiveness for spreading the benefits of science and technology to all humanity.
