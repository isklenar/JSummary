WASHINGTON, DC –For generations to come, the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness.
But what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Hamas.
The war exposed flaws in Hamas’ judgment.
Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce.
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged.
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price.
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.
One indicator to watch for: the length of that ceasefire.
Palestinians will recognize Hamas’s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat, which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment.
