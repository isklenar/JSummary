VANCOUVER – Despite the growing importance of science in the modern world, science education remains a remote and minor issue for most people.
After all, science and technology are not only the primary drivers of growth in the modern economy; they are also increasingly central to many major public policy issues, most notably those surrounding climate change and health care.
To be sure, the need for more and better science education has not been entirely ignored.
Moreover, it is doubtful that great progress can be made at the primary and secondary levels until a higher standard of science learning is set at the post-secondary level.
Scientists and engineers are being produced at rates comparable or higher than in the past, and, while few non-science students find their required science courses enjoyable or useful, that is considered to be inherent to the subject.
However, the past 20 years or so have witnessed the emergence of research on science education at the university level carried out by scientists in their respective disciplines.
Science education research clearly shows that a true understanding of science, as demonstrated by how it is practiced, is not merely about learning information.
Rather, it is about developing a way of thinking about a discipline that reflects a particular perception of how “knowledge” is established, its extent and limitations, how it describes nature, and how it can be usefully applied in a variety of contexts.
With continued research and effective implementation of new findings about science education, it will be possible to achieve far more meaningful science learning for all university students.
