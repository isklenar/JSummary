It is possible for a child born just ten years from now to live in a world where AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are on the wane.
Recent successes in Brazil against AIDS, in Mozambique against malaria, and in China against TB, show what can be achieved on a global scale with more resources.
Created in 2002 as a partnership between governments and civil society, the Global Fund is unique in the way it aims to deliver assistance.
Investments in effective prevention, treatment and research in 2005 and 2006 will save millions of lives, lessen the socio-economic impact of the diseases in poorer countries, and remove the need for increased spending on these chronic crises in the future.
The Global Fund plays an important role in this funding environment, providing approximately 66% of all current external funds in the fight against TB, 45% in the fight against malaria, and 20% of all external support to combat HIV/AIDS.
