CHICAGO – Throughout the West, declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity.
Since the mid-nineteenth century, the West has depended on technical innovation and scientific derring-do for its influence and growth.
In general, competition in science and technology is a blessing – the more advanced a nation is, the better a customer it is.
The so-called “Sputnik shock” convinced America and the West of the need for radical reform of science education, particularly recruitment, training, and retention of teachers.
The sequence Physics-Chemistry-Biology implies that continuous collegial professional development for teachers is essential.
Teachers (including those in mathematics) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses, their essential coherence, and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works.
But to restore the vitality of science, we need to look at the entire educational system: teachers from pre-school through high school, state and national standards, productive and educationally reinforcing assessments, teaching materials and educational technology, and progress in the neurosciences, cognitive psychology, developmental biology, and nutrition.
