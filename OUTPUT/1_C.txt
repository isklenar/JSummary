But making global warming the world’s top priority means that we shuffle other major challenges down our “to do” list.
Tell that to the four million people starving to death, to the three million victims of HIV/AIDS, or to the billions of people who lack access to clean drinking water.
They point out, for example, that malaria deaths will climb along with temperatures, because potentially killer mosquitoes thrive in warmer areas.
But it’s not as simple as the bumper sticker slogan “Fight climate change and ward off malaria.”
The number of people at risk of malaria would be reduced by about 0.2% by 2085.
We know that dissemination of mosquito nets and malaria prevention programs could cut malaria incidence in half by 2015 for about $3 billion annually – less than 2% of the cost of Kyoto.
There is a massive amount of good that we can do through practical, affordable approaches like HIV/AIDS education, malaria prevention, and the provision of micro-nutrients or clean water.
