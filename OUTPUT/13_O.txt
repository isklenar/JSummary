Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes.
The nets reduce the number of bites, and the amount of illness, but they do not eliminate them.
If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
Rich countries would buy bed nets from companies that produce them and work with African governments to distribute them free of charge to every African household.
And they would work with African governments to ensure that the correct medicines are available for quick use within each village.
Malaria control now faces a period of increasing urgency, as well as renewed hope.
Malaria is spreading, and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria.
But there is also a growing realization that malaria is a disaster that must be addressed.
Aid can work wonders if it is practical and directed to those in need.
Malaria control can demonstrate this world-saving lesson once again.
