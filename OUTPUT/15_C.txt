All that can be said is that the processes involved must, being chemical, have been highly deterministic and reproducible, that is, bound to occur under prevailing conditions.
The second key word is replicability, the ability of certain information-bearing molecules to induce the making of (complementary) copies of themselves by the machineries responsible for the synthesis of their kind.
Replication allowed the endless reproduction of the same entities, generation after generation, which is the basis of genetic continuity.
The necessary outcome, as first divined by Charles Darwin, was the selection of those lineages most apt to survive and, especially, produce progeny under existing conditions.
With replication, chance made its appearance, by way of the variations, or mutations, that were offered to the screening action of natural selection.
Irrespective of the arguments put forward in support of ID, which have been abundantly refuted, let it simply be stated that a theory based on an a priori declaration that things are not naturally explainable is not a scientific theory.
By definition, the science is based on the idea that the object of study is naturally explainable.
