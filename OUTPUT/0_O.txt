According to modern scienceâ€™s version of Genesis -- less colorful than the biblical story, but no less wonderful -- Earth was born, together with the Sun and the other planets, in a whirlwind of gas and dust, some 4.5 billion years ago, a little more than nine billion years after the Big Bang.
Primitive organisms arose from nonliving matter in what were probably hot, sulfurous, metal-laden, volcanic waters.
Organic chemistry, so named because it was believed to be a prerogative of living organisms, has turned out to be the most widespread and banal chemistry: the chemistry of carbon.
Something similar happened in the origin of life, but along pathways, by the action of catalysts, and with sources of energy that remain to be identified.
The second key word is replicability, the ability of certain information-bearing molecules to induce the making of (complementary) copies of themselves by the machineries responsible for the synthesis of their kind.
In the beginning, replication concerned only RNA molecules.
Replication allowed the endless reproduction of the same entities, generation after generation, which is the basis of genetic continuity.
This process became added to chemistry as soon as replicability appeared, operating first on molecules and, subsequently, on increasingly complex assemblages, until the present day.
