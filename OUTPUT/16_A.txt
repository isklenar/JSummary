CHICAGO – Throughout the West, declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity.
But the West now faces serious competition from the rising nations of Asia, where education in math and science is flourishing.
In general, competition in science and technology is a blessing – the more advanced a nation is, the better a customer it is.
But it must be recognized that falling educational standards will eventually hit economic growth.
But to restore the vitality of science, we need to look at the entire educational system: teachers from pre-school through high school, state and national standards, productive and educationally reinforcing assessments, teaching materials and educational technology, and progress in the neurosciences, cognitive psychology, developmental biology, and nutrition.
And leadership for this huge revolutionary effort will probably have to come from visionary business executives whose profits depend on education and rationality.
