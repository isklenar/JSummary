It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different, but otherwise normal individuals.
Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual.
With only a few exceptions, all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies (one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father).
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies.
That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a technique known as “array-based comparative genomic hybridization” (array-CGH), revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics.
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared.
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought.
Overall, we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment.
