MELBOURNE – In April, Germany’s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis.
Is the new German law a model for other countries to follow as we grapple with the ethical issues posed by our growing knowledge of human genetics?
If insurance companies outside Germany are permitted to require genetic tests while German companies are prohibited from doing so, then people who know they have life-shortening genetic diagnoses will get their life insurance from German insurance companies.
But, in the long term, if we are serious about prohibiting such tests, we need an international agreement – on both insurance and employment – to ensure a level playing field for all countries.
The German law’s most controversial feature is a prohibition on prenatal genetic testing for diseases that will manifest themselves only in adulthood.
No parents could want this future for their children.
Prenatal testing of fetuses (or of in vitro embryos before transfer to the uterus) is now well established throughout the developed world.
The new German law makes such tests a crime.
The same is true of tests for the genes that strongly predispose women to breast cancer.
What could be the thinking behind such a law?
But if we take that into account, should we not also take into consideration the life of the child who the parents would have had, if they had been able to use prenatal diagnosis and be sure of having a child who does not carry the gene for the disease?
