In June, the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were, in effect, “made to order” lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult.
That achievement appeared to take us significantly closer to a world in which patients could be given cell or tissue transplants that their bodies would not reject, because the biological materials, cloned from the patients themselves, would be a perfect match.
But then Hwang’s collaborators began questioning the validity of the experiment itself, and Hwang notified Science that he wished to withdraw the paper.
If Hwang was not the first to do it, someone else eventually will.
For example, when President George W. Bush announced in 2001 that the United States would not fund research into new stem-cell lines that are created from human embryos, he offered the following reason: “Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being.”
But it is precisely this reasoning that is threatened by what Hwang and his team claimed to have achieved.
This possibility highlights the weakness of the argument that abortion, too, is wrong because it destroys a genetically unique human being.
In the absence of special reasons, like a change in sexual partners, there seems to be no reason to prefer the existence of one child to that of the other.
