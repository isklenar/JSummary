A doctor admits that most patients are sent home without testing or treatment: the clinic has run out of medicine.
Most estimates suggest that global warming will put 3% more of the earth’s population at risk of catching malaria by 2100.
In comparison, spending $3 billion annually on mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade.
But, as with malaria, all of the evidence shows that direct policies are much more effective than carbon cuts.
For every person saved from malnutrition through climate policies, the same money could have saved half a million people from micronutrient malnutrition through direct policies.
If we spend vast amounts of money on carbon cuts in the mistaken belief that we are stopping malaria and reducing malnutrition, we are less likely to put aside money for the direct policies that would help today.
If we spent the same dollar on simple policies to help malnutrition or malaria now, we could do $20 or more good – 1000 times better, when all impacts are taken into account.
