WASHINGTON, DC –For generations to come, the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness.
Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce.
If Hamas comes out ahead, Abbas’s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO.
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged.
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.
It is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase.
Abbas, supported by the United States and the European Union, may have control over significant funding.
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza’s near destruction is a price that had to be paid.
Many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the “resistance.” There is a precedent for this argument: Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut’s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006.
Two weeks ago, Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East.
