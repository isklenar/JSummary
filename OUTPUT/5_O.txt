BERLIN – Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has fought seven wars against its neighbors, including the recent war in Gaza.
From a military perspective, Israel eventually won all of these wars – or at least didn’t lose them.
This is why, to this day, people on both sides are dying.
The central question for both sides remains unanswered: where does Israel end and Palestine start?
On the Israeli side, approximately 200,000 settlers on the West Bank and further development of the settlements weigh heavier than all noble words about two states.
Their loss of legitimacy will not be reparable.
An initial truce, by means of international mediation, can lead to a monitored long-term truce and reconstruction in Gaza.
The alternative to a two-state solution is continuation of the conflict and the de facto reality of a one-state solution in which Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will, sooner rather than later, constitute a majority.
For Israel and the Palestinians, this is a dire perspective from both a strategic and a humanitarian point of view.
Indeed, it is hopeless.
