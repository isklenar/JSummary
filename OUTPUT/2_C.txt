SAN FRANCISCO – Science provides an invaluable source of guidance to individuals and governments.
And yet, what science knows is far too often overlooked when high-stakes decisions are made.
It is the business of politicians, not scientists, to consider the relative costs and benefits of the options before them, weighing them as they see fit in reaching their conclusions.
Through a rigorous review process, the Academies insist that each report be limited to what science can say about the subject based on evidence and logic, without preempting the decisions that need to be made by others.
However, there are other important science-based issues that require study by internationally-based organizations in order to be widely accepted.
The IAC is governed by a Board that includes a rotating group of 15 Academy presidents from around the world, representing nations at a range of economic development levels, and its reports present a truly international perspective backed by the world’s best scientists and engineers.
The combination of the IAP and the IAC is an important new experiment for providing international scientific advice – an experiment that has only just begun to demonstrate its potential effectiveness for spreading the benefits of science and technology to all humanity.
