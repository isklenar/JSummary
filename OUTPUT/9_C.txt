Whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed, if a formal one is eventually agreed.
For the moment, Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender.
Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce.
With open borders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank, putting enormous pressure on Abbas, the leader of the rival Fatah movement, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas.
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged.
One indicator to watch for: the length of that ceasefire.
Abbas, supported by the United States and the European Union, may have control over significant funding.
Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction.
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza’s near destruction is a price that had to be paid.
The biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas’ political goals.
It remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk’s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas, or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel.
