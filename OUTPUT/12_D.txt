Most estimates suggest that global warming will put 3% more of the earthâ€™s population at risk of catching malaria by 2100.
In comparison, spending $3 billion annually on mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade.
Of course, malaria is far from the only reason we worry about global warming.
The choice is stark: for a few hundred million dollars, we could help almost half of humanity now.
If we spend vast amounts of money on carbon cuts in the mistaken belief that we are stopping malaria and reducing malnutrition, we are less likely to put aside money for the direct policies that would help today.
