VANCOUVER – Despite the growing importance of science in the modern world, science education remains a remote and minor issue for most people.
Moreover, it is doubtful that great progress can be made at the primary and secondary levels until a higher standard of science learning is set at the post-secondary level.
The results of this research, and the dramatically improved gains in learning and interest achieved in associated teaching experiments, show that there are tremendous opportunities to improve university science education.
Realizing these opportunities, however, will require a different pedagogical approach, one that treats science education as a science, with rigorous standards for teaching effectiveness.
In many respects, science education today is similar to medicine during the mid-1800’s, when a new level of scientific rigor confronted long-held beliefs and well-respected traditional medical practices.
With continued research and effective implementation of new findings about science education, it will be possible to achieve far more meaningful science learning for all university students.
