If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
Africa turns out to be especially unlucky, because it has a combination of high temperatures and the mosquitos that are likely to transmit the disease.
As a result, Africa accounts for 90% of all malaria deaths in the world – including roughly two million children per year.
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets, which are treated with insecticide.
First, Africa’s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines.
Second, African villagers lack access to cars or trucks, so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic.
If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
Malaria is spreading, and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria.
