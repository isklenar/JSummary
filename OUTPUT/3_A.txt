VANCOUVER â€“ Despite the growing importance of science in the modern world, science education remains a remote and minor issue for most people.
After all, science and technology are not only the primary drivers of growth in the modern economy; they are also increasingly central to many major public policy issues, most notably those surrounding climate change and health care.
The results of this research, and the dramatically improved gains in learning and interest achieved in associated teaching experiments, show that there are tremendous opportunities to improve university science education.
Realizing these opportunities, however, will require a different pedagogical approach, one that treats science education as a science, with rigorous standards for teaching effectiveness.
With continued research and effective implementation of new findings about science education, it will be possible to achieve far more meaningful science learning for all university students.
It will also enable them to make wiser decisions on critically important matters of public policy, and to be far more creative and effective members of the work force.
