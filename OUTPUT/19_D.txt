Science, it seems, is drifting into political dangers it has not faced since before the Enlightenment.
Europe began its own American-style debate on the origins of life when Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna cast doubt on the acceptability of Darwinism and evolutionary theory to people who see themselves as faithful Roman Catholics.
Indeed, the religious background of Europe’s nations clearly manifested itself in various European laws on such research, with the United Kingdom and Sweden being the most liberal and Italy, Austria, and Poland the most restrictive.
But none of these debates directly challenged the role of science in society or posed, as Cardinal Schönborn did, the idea that religion and science are potentially incompatible.
When dogmatic faith enters politics, compromises on controversial issues, which are indispensable in a democracy, become difficult to achieve.
Although the language of religion was not used overtly, the debate in Asia reflected the same fears that science is somehow “out of control” and far too powerful.
It is perceived as a motor of economic growth, but also as a threat to our security and beliefs.
This autonomy has served science well, and independent and accountable science has served society and the economy well.
If this beneficial relationship is to be maintained, scientific independence – from both religious dogmatism and governmental intervention – must be defended.
