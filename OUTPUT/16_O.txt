But it must be recognized that falling educational standards will eventually hit economic growth.
The West, particularly the United States, has lived through such a moment of recognition before, when the USSR launched Sputnik in 1957.
All other sciences – geology, astronomy, neuroscience, oceanography, and myriad hyphenated subjects – depend upon overlapping combinations of biology, chemistry, and physics.
This sequence of study was devised in 1893.
Moreover, physics begins with everyday phenomena requiring few new words (as opposed to conventional ninth-grade biology): motion, velocity, acceleration, falling objects, a sense of gravity as a force, and some new concepts, e.g. mass, momentum, and energy, but with crisp definitions.
Ninth-grade physics, unlike ninth-grade biology, illustrates the grand sweep of the laws of nature, and the power of an equation to describe a vast number of different phenomena can be taught at this level.
These orders of magnitude require metaphors and repetition, but they serve as crucial concepts in our world, especially in cosmology and in evolutionary biology.
Tenth-grade chemistry makes use of ninth-grade physics, deepening and enriching the student’s grasp, but no basic chemical or biological principles are required for ninth-grade physics.
Chemistry is largely a study of molecules, and when they are complex, there is the mysterious transition to life and biology.
At all stages of the science curriculum, basic questions must be asked.
The chemist Dalton first gave a proof of the existence of atoms and the engineer Sadi Carnot first gave a proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
The sequence Physics-Chemistry-Biology implies that continuous collegial professional development for teachers is essential.
