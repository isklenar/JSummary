Ugly debates about religion and science usually seem to be confined to the United States.
In recent months, however, such debates have begun to spread – first to Europe and then around the world.
But none of these debates directly challenged the role of science in society or posed, as Cardinal Schönborn did, the idea that religion and science are potentially incompatible.

It is perceived as a motor of economic growth, but also as a threat to our security and beliefs.
Cultural worldviews and religion, of course, will continue to shape the overall cultural and value context within which science and technology interact.
