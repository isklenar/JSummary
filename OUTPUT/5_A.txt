BERLIN – Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has fought seven wars against its neighbors, including the recent war in Gaza.
Indeed, the core conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has remained almost unchanged throughout the past 60 years.
The United Nations’ Partition Plan of 1947, which split the former British Mandate of Palestine between both peoples, was not and still is not accepted until this day.
Of course, Israel made a “cold peace” with Egypt and Jordan, and also established diplomatic relations with a few other Arab countries, but nothing has really changed at the core of the conflict, despite the Oslo peace process of the 1990’s and other treaties and agreements with the Palestinians.
The central question for both sides remains unanswered: where does Israel end and Palestine start?
Without a territorial compromise between Israel and the Palestinians, the conflict will go on endlessly, for it is viewed as existential by both sides.
This means that the West’s policy of isolating Hamas in order to weaken it, which has been pursued since Hamas’s victory in a free and fair election in 2006, has failed.
Both Israel and the West will no longer be able to postpone the question of how to deal with Hamas, because Abbas and Fatah are now too weak and discredited to negotiate a peace settlement.
Trying to extricate both parties from the strategic dead-end into which they have maneuvered themselves will be possible only from outside.
If an imposed solution fails, the entire region will begin to slip into a dangerous confrontation during the first years of Barack Obama’s presidency.
