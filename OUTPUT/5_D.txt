The United Nations’ Partition Plan of 1947, which split the former British Mandate of Palestine between both peoples, was not and still is not accepted until this day.
All those involved know that, in the end, only the borders of June 1967 – including Jerusalem and a negotiated, smaller territorial exchange – can be acceptable to both sides, however painful.
Given the facts on the ground created by Israel, there are justified doubts about whether a two-state solution is feasible at all.
Both Israel and the West will no longer be able to postpone the question of how to deal with Hamas, because Abbas and Fatah are now too weak and discredited to negotiate a peace settlement.
Trying to extricate both parties from the strategic dead-end into which they have maneuvered themselves will be possible only from outside.
First, the United States must attempt to integrate Syria and Iran into a regional solution that also fundamentally changes conditions for both Israelis and Palestinians.
Second, the US must impose a two-state solution on the parties involved, which will require both determination and maintaining the unity of the main international actors.
