VANCOUVER â€“ Despite the growing importance of science in the modern world, science education remains a remote and minor issue for most people.
After all, science and technology are not only the primary drivers of growth in the modern economy; they are also increasingly central to many major public policy issues, most notably those surrounding climate change and health care.
To be sure, the need for more and better science education has not been entirely ignored.
But little of this attention has been aimed at post-secondary science education, the only level for which there is data showing how to make substantial improvements without enormous costs.
However, the past 20 years or so have witnessed the emergence of research on science education at the university level carried out by scientists in their respective disciplines.
The results of this research, and the dramatically improved gains in learning and interest achieved in associated teaching experiments, show that there are tremendous opportunities to improve university science education.
Realizing these opportunities, however, will require a different pedagogical approach, one that treats science education as a science, with rigorous standards for teaching effectiveness.
