If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
Africa turns out to be especially unlucky, because it has a combination of high temperatures and the mosquitos that are likely to transmit the disease.
As a result, Africa accounts for 90% of all malaria deaths in the world – including roughly two million children per year.
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets, which are treated with insecticide.
If people get bitten despite the nets, they require treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.
First, Africa’s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines.
Second, African villagers lack access to cars or trucks, so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic.
There are one billion people living in rich donor countries, and the total cost of comprehensive malaria control in Africa – giving bed nets at no cost to all Africans, and providing the right medicines within every village – is around $2.5 billion per year, or just $2.50 per citizen of the rich countries.
Rather than giving away bed nets, rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor, albeit at heavily discounted prices.
The tragic result has been extremely low use of nets throughout most of Africa, since impoverished people lack the purchasing power to buy nets.
Second, donor governments have failed to promote simple ways to ensure the availability of medicines in villages across the continent.
