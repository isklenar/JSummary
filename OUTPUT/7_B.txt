RAMALLAH – President-elect Barack Obama’s defiantly positive campaign for change has inspired hope not only in the millions of Americans who voted for him, but also in the billions of others worldwide who could not.
Across the Middle East, as elsewhere, expectations are building that his presidency will herald a new era for America’s role in the world.
Obama’s electoral triumph arrives at a symbolic moment in Palestinian history.
This month marks the twentieth anniversary of the Palestinian Declaration of Independence.
The US can take four practical steps to help negotiations move forward immediately.
The first step is early engagement.
Second, the US should establish a credible enforcement mechanism to ensure that the parties comply with their respective obligations, particularly an immediate freeze on Israeli settlement activity throughout the occupied Palestinian territory.
Third, the new administration should encourage the re-engagement of its Quartet partners – the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia – in the mediation process.
Fourth, the US should renew its respect for international law by recognizing three principles: that the 1967 pre-occupation boundaries must be respected in any negotiations; that Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem must be safeguarded, with guaranteed access for Muslims, Christians, and Jews to their holy sites; and that the plight of Palestinian refugees, whose 60-year ordeal remains emblematic of the Palestinian predicament, must be acknowledged and fairly addressed.
